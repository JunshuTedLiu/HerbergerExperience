        </h1>

        <p>
            It's not an app. It's an experience.</p>
        <p>Arizona State University was founded in 1885. Every year, thousands of people around the world come to ASU and start their brand-new college life. One of the important parts is to get familiar with this campus by taking a campus tour.</p>
        <img src="assets/ASU/asu_university_horiz_rgb_maroongold_600.png"  class="centered-images">
        <p>Sadly, over the past 133 years, the way people take campus tour has never been changed at all. Although there's abundant information on the Internet, <strong>there's no <em>interaction</em> between browsing webpage to get information and walking through the campus, the buildings, and the facilities.</strong> Students need a convenient and interactive way to get to know and access all the resources on campus.</p>
        <p>Introducing the <strong>Herberger Experience</strong> app, a new way to take a campus tour at ASU Herberger Institute of Design and the Arts with an Augmented Reality experience.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our mission is to change the way we take the campus tour.</strong> Say goodbye to the typical campus tour. Immerse yourself in the friendly user interface with interactive AR and video experience, and find out your new path of study.

            This is a Digital Culture capstone project for 2017 ~ 2018 academic year. Learn more about the <a href="https://artsmediaengineering.asu.edu/degree-programs/digital-culture">Digital Culture</a> program offered by ASU HIDA.

            Who's idea?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This was a capstone topic originally purposed by <a href="https://lnolson.github.io/"><strong>Loren Olson</strong></a>, a professor from ASU School of Arts, Media and Engineering.
        </p>

            Starting the Fall 2017 semester, Junshu Liu, Annie Norenberg, and Stephen Moyer (graduated December 2017) joined this project with professor Loren Olson. The next semester, two new members join us, Trevor McLaws and Logan Park, and we decided to go for a completely different direction.

            Our Plan
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Herberger Experience project is currently in progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting March 12, we will start publishing our project to the public for user testing and feedback, while updating and improving the project at the same time. We will also start marketing the Herberger Experience product through posters on campus and social media. (Twitter account available Late March.)
        </p>
        <!--<p>
            We are expecting to complete the whole project no later than <strong>April 19, 2018</strong>, one day prior to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/599371870398784/">ODESZA's A Moment Apart Tour</a> in Chandler, AZ. And then, we will celebrate our victory together during this event, also our very last concert in the valley before graduation. We all are expecting for this exciting moment.
        </p>-->
        <p>
            On April 27, we will demo our product during the Spring 2018 Digital Culture Showcase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our graduation commencement will be on May 7, 2018. Before we graduated, we will talk with our mentor Loren about continuing running and maintenance of this project by recruiting future students. We will come with a full instruction and documentation by earlier this May.
