            <a-text width='5' color='#FFFFFF' width=3 value="Like I said, over the past 133 years, the way people take campus tour has never been changed at all. Although there's abundant information on the Internet, there's no interaction between browsing webpage to get information and walking through the campus, the buildings, and the facilities. Students need a convenient and interactive way to get to know and access all the resources on campus.

Introducing the Herberger Experience app, a new way to take a campus tour at ASU Herberger Institute of Design and the Arts with an Augmented Reality experience.

Our mission is to change the way we take the campus tour. Say goodbye to the typical campus tour. Immerse yourself in the friendly user interface with interactive AR and video experience, and find out your new path of study.">
