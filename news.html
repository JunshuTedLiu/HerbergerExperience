    <h2>
        LAUNCHING, REBRANDING, AND READY FOR PRIVATE SHOWCASE!
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Tempe, AZ</strong> - The 2018 Spring Break is nearly over. So, here's the question - how to properly <em>re-</em>start this semester in a FUN way?
    </p>
    <p>
        During the spring break, we have significant progress on our project. On March 12, we will launch the Herberger Experience project (Beta) to the public for user testing. Everyone back to the school from the break will have chances to experiment with our project. <a href="index.html">Our official website</a> will be available by this date, and hopefully, we will put our "AR-code"s (QR codes and markers) inside the Herberger buildings as more as possible, starting from the Stauffer B-wing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we are re-branding the Herberger Experience. We decided to re-brand our name as "<em>Herberger Experience</em>" (formerly "<em><strong>The</strong> Herberger Experience</em>"). We will sometimes say "the Herberger Experience" depends on the context.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Digital Culture Private Showcase will be on Friday, March 30, 2018, from 12 to 2 pm at Stauffer B125. We're ready for our very first demo to all Digital Culture faculties and students.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this is a "beta" release and the project is still in progress, we're still working on adding more contents, improve our designs, and get permission on putting our "AR-code"s on campus. You're welcome to give us any feedback and advice by <a href="contact.html">contacting us</a> through e-mail.
    </p>
