# The Herberger Experience
It's not an app. It's an experience.<br>
<br>
Arizona State University was founded in 1885. Every year, thousands of people around the world come to ASU and start their brand-new college life. One of the important parts is to get familiar with this campus by taking a campus tour.<br>
<br>
Sadly, over the past 133 years, the way people take campus tour has never been changed at all. Although there's abundant information on the Internet, <strong>there's no <em>interaction</em> between browsing webpage to get information and walking through the campus, the buildings, and the facilities.</strong> Students need a convenient and interactive way to get to know and access all the resources on campus.<br>
<br>
Introducing the <strong>Herberger Experience</strong> app, a new way to take a campus tour at ASU Herberger Institute of Design and the Arts with an Augmented Reality experience.<br>
<br>
<strong>Our mission is to change the way we take the campus tour.</strong> Say goodbye to the typical campus tour. Immerse yourself in the friendly user interface with interactive AR and video experience, and find out your new path of study.
