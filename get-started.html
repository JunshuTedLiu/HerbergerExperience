        Get Started
    </h1>

    <p>
        When you are inside a building, you might see some AR markers on the wall with QR codes and "Hiro" written on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are basically taped next to the doorplates of the rooms. Those rooms are facilities and faculty offices. Those codes contain information that could help you get familiar with these facilities and faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
        So now you are on campus, and you saw a place that you are curious about what it is. Then, you saw the code next to the door that said "Scan this".
    </p>
    <h2>
        STEP 1.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Scan it. Scan the QR code, and you will be directed to a webpage.
    </p>
    <h2>
        STEP 2.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Allow this webpage to access your camera.
    </p>
    <h2>
        STEP 3.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Now, scan the whole "AR-code", which is an AR marker.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Here you go!</strong> The information about that place will be appeared on your phone.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you need to scan another code, please scan that QR code again first, instead of using the old webpage.
    </p>
